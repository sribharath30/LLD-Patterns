A **class diagram** is a type of static structure diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that describes the structure of a system by showing its classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships among them. It's widely used in software design to provide a blueprint of the application's architecture.

### **Components of a Class Diagram**

1. **Class**
   - Represented as a rectangle divided into three sections:
     - **Class Name**: The name of the class.
     - **Attributes**: Properties or fields of the class.
     - **Methods**: Operations or functions the class can perform.

2. **Relationships**
   - **Association**: A structural connection between classes.
   - **Aggregation**: A "whole-part" relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole.
   - **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole.
   - **Inheritance**: Represents "is-a" relationships between classes.
   - **Dependency**: Represents a "uses" relationship.
   - **Multiplicity**: Indicates the number of objects involved in a relationship (e.g., 1..*).

3. **Visibility Modifiers**
   - `+` Public: Accessible from anywhere.
   - `-` Private: Accessible only within the class.
   - `#` Protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

### **Example**

Imagine a system for a library management system. Below is the example of a class diagram for such a system.

---

#### Classes and Relationships:
1. **Classes:**
   - `Library`
     - Attributes: `name`, `location`
     - Methods: `addBook()`, `removeBook()`
   - `Book`
     - Attributes: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`
     - Methods: `getDetails()`
   - `Member`
     - Attributes: `memberID`, `name`, `membershipType`
     - Methods: `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`
   - `Staff`
     - Attributes: `staffID`, `name`, `designation`
     - Methods: `manageLibrary()`

2. **Relationships:**
   - Association: `Library` has `Book`.
   - Aggregation: `Library` contains `Member` and `Staff` (members and staff can exist independently of the library).
   - Composition: `Book` has `title`, `author`, `ISBN` (a book cannot exist without these attributes).
   - Inheritance: `Staff` inherits from `Member` (Staff is a type of Member).

#### Visual Representation:

```plaintext
----------------------------------------
|               Library                |
----------------------------------------
| + name: String                       |
| + location: String                   |
----------------------------------------
| + addBook(book: Book): void          |
| + removeBook(book: Book): void       |
----------------------------------------

    1          *          1          *
Library  --------> Book         ---------> Member
                      has                  borrows
```

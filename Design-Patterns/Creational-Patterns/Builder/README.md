The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction process of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

This pattern is particularly useful when you want to create an object with many optional parameters or configurations. It provides better control over the construction process and ensures that the object is immutable after construction.

---

### Key Components of Builder Pattern:
1. **Builder**:
   - Provides methods to build parts of the object step by step.
   - Includes methods to set or add each attribute of the object.

2. **Concrete Builder**:
   - Implements the `Builder` interface.
   - Maintains the instance of the object being built.

3. **Product**:
   - The final object that is constructed.

4. **Director** (Optional):
   - Controls the building process and defines the order in which the building steps are called.

---

### Advantages:
- **Immutability**: Ensures the object remains immutable after creation.
- **Readability**: Construction steps are clearly defined.
- **Flexibility**: You can reuse the building process for different representations of the object.

### When to Use:
- When the object creation process involves multiple steps or configurations.
- When creating immutable objects with different combinations of attributes.
- When the object should remain complex but its construction process should be simplified.

You're right to ask that question! In the implementation above, the **Builder** and **Concrete Builder** are combined into one class: `ComputerBuilder`. For clarity, Iâ€™ll explicitly separate them into two distinct entities to match the **Builder Pattern** structure more accurately.

Here's the updated implementation with a clear distinction between **Builder** and **Concrete Builder**:

```javascript
// Product: The object that will be built
class Computer {
  constructor() {
    this.cpu = null;
    this.ram = null;
    this.storage = null;
    this.gpu = null;
    this.isWaterCooled = false;
  }
}

// Builder: Abstract interface that defines the building steps
class Builder {
  setCPU(cpu) {}
  setRAM(ram) {}
  setStorage(storage) {}
  setGPU(gpu) {}
  setWaterCooling(isWaterCooled) {}
  build() {}
}

// Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface and constructs the Product
class ComputerBuilder extends Builder {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.computer = new Computer(); // Maintains the instance of the product being built
  }

  setCPU(cpu) {
    this.computer.cpu = cpu;
    return this; // Enables method chaining
  }

  setRAM(ram) {
    this.computer.ram = ram;
    return this;
  }

  setStorage(storage) {
    this.computer.storage = storage;
    return this;
  }

  setGPU(gpu) {
    this.computer.gpu = gpu;
    return this;
  }

  setWaterCooling(isWaterCooled) {
    this.computer.isWaterCooled = isWaterCooled;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return this.computer; // Returns the final product
  }
}

// Director: Controls the building process and defines the order of steps
class ComputerDirector {
  static buildGamingPC() {
    const builder = new ComputerBuilder();
    return builder
      .setCPU("AMD Ryzen 9")
      .setRAM("32GB")
      .setStorage("1TB NVMe SSD")
      .setGPU("NVIDIA RTX 3080")
      .setWaterCooling(true)
      .build();
  }

  static buildOfficePC() {
    const builder = new ComputerBuilder();
    return builder
      .setCPU("Intel i5")
      .setRAM("16GB")
      .setStorage("512GB SSD")
      .build();
  }
}

// Usage:
const gamingPC = ComputerDirector.buildGamingPC();
console.log(gamingPC);

const officePC = ComputerDirector.buildOfficePC();
console.log(officePC);
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Builder**:
   - Represented by the abstract `Builder` class, which defines the blueprint for constructing a product.
   - Contains methods like `setCPU`, `setRAM`, etc., as placeholders.

2. **Concrete Builder**:
   - The `ComputerBuilder` class implements the `Builder` interface and constructs the `Computer` object step by step.

3. **Product**:
   - The `Computer` class is the object being built.

4. **Director**:
   - The `ComputerDirector` class orchestrates the construction steps to create different configurations of the product.

Now, the pattern fully adheres to the Builder Pattern's structure.

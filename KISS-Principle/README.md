The **KISS Principle** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) promotes simplicity in software development by avoiding unnecessary complexity. The goal is to write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and debug.

### Key Points:
- **Avoid over-engineering**.
- **Prefer clarity** over complicated solutions.

### Example:

#### Over-Complicated:
```javascript
function checkEvenOdd(number) {
    if ((number % 2 === 0 && number > 0) || (number % 2 !== 0 && number <= 0)) {
        return number + " is even or odd";
    }
    return "Invalid number";
}
```

#### Simple Approach:
```javascript
function checkEvenOdd(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0 ? `${number} is even` : `${number} is odd`;
}
```

### Benefits:
- **Easier to read and understand**.
- **Simpler to maintain**.
- **Fewer bugs**. 

The KISS principle helps create cleaner, more effective code by focusing on simplicity.
